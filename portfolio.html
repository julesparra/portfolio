    <p><u>Notes</u>: Navina is startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel that helps independent accountable care organizations (ACOs) limit the money and time spent on paperwork and other monotonous tasks by automating the processes through artificial intelligence. I conducted market research on potential ACOs to reach out to and communicated regularly with my team members, project manager, and the Navina executive team to better understnad the client's needs to strategize, act and advise accordingly. I created slide decks, one-pagers, and infographics to illustrate the meaning behind my research and data analysis. This is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MFcsOwPS4lNvp9jpFgHnymE6tdORa8xUhAqgroHOKI4/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">infographic</a> our team designed to present our findings to the rest of our chapter; in light of logistical obstacles due to the pandemic, we were unable to present a slide deck we otherwise would have. <b><i>I was recognized as Consultant of the Semester for my work with Navina.</i></b></p>
